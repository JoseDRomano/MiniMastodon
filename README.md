# MiniMastodon
In this project, we created a distributed system that could work like Mastodon's. We used both REST and SOAP procotols to build it - even tough we had some trouble ruuning the SOAP version bc of an error of Casts and we its still giving some headaches. In order to use the tester that was provided for us, read the README.
